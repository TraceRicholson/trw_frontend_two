# Who created this thing anyway?
That's a fantastic question.  One we definitely have an answer to.  First, we'll need you to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).  Just in case the "Jamie" incident happens again.  First Ricky, and now Jamie.  Poor Jamie...

Now that you've signed that, below is a list of our team members and GitHub usernames in case you want to see other random projects we've created:<br/>
