# What exactly is this?
We're so glad you asked.  Robot Kitchen is a website containing a select, currated list of recipes for your tasting enjoyment.  It's a simple way to get the recipe you want without having to read 20 paragraphs about a person.  This really is the ultimate recipe website you've been searching for your whole life.

# How do I install this?
Easy!  See steps 1 - 53 below.

# Who created this thing anyway?
That's a fantastic question.  One we definitely have an answer to.  First, we'll need you to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).  Just in case the "Ricky" incident happens again.  Poor Ricky...

Now that you've signed that, below is a list of our team members and GitHub usernames in case you want to see other random projects we've created:<br/>
